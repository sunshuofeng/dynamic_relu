# dynamic_relu
pytorch implementation about dynamic_relu



This is a repository for individual implementations of this paper:[Dynamic Relu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10027), and the complete code will be published later.

I have completed all relu code,but it has not been tested for correctness.

As a newcomer to the CV field, this is my first attempt to implement the paper code without the official code, so there may be a lot of errors.

If you find a bug in the code or have any Suggestions for improvement, please let me know, and I'll fix it right awayÔºÅ
